<ul>How I Use Photography To Capture Our World Today</ul>
<body>
<p>
    Photography is a powerful language to use, as the world continues to evolve.  The world is just what we’re a part of and we should never cease to live in the current moment.  Photography however, is a great tool to use in order to capture such moments, as we go through our lives.  I find myself using photography as a way to archive certain moments in my life and others.  I feel as if memory is enhanced with such use, and I actively support the idea of using photography as a way to capture the memories that others tell people to live in the moment for.

    The world is everchanging, from life moving to and fro and seasons changing, to businesses in your neighborhood shutting down and reopening as new ones.  Taking photos and keeping a visual memory, beyond the mental one you create once you’ve experienced it, is very important as it visually supports what you remember.  I love using photography as a time capsule, that allows a memory to truly live on forever.  It also helps keep track of family, friends, pets and even materials.  Past relationships, romantic or platonic, are also all very alive through photography and that is one of the most powerful uses for it.  As I take photos, I find myself constantly in tune with the fact that I am a memory keeper for everybody in my life.  My friends call me an archivist, and I continue to live up to the title.

    Others can also use photography for the creation of jokes on the internet, mixing photos with text, maybe even creating informational pieces and memorial pieces.  The point of each category of combinations are for the most part self explanatory.  The act in doing so helped to shape our culture and continues to shape it to this day.
